I searched for the following categories within a radius of 10 km from the city centre:  badminton courts, baseball fields, basketball courts, golf courses, boxing gyms, climbing gyms, gymnastics gyms, martial arts dojos, pilates studios, yoga studios, hockey fields and rinks, rugby pitches, skate parks, skating rinks, soccer fields, squash courts, tennis courts, and volleyball courts. Then, I calculated the top ten categories within each city, and used this feature to cluster the cities."
